# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website — a project I’ve been iterating on for some time. It showcases my work, skills, and a bit of my personality through design and code.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a deployable, responsive site
- Keep the design minimal and focused
- Emphasize typography and clean layout

---

## 🧠 Background

This website is personal. Over time, I've experimented with multiple portfolio designs — some more complex, some more experimental — but eventually, I decided to go with something clean and minimal.

The color palette is intentionally limited to three shades:

1. **Light black** for the background  
2. **Black** for cards and hover effects  
3. **Green** as an accent color  

The typography is a central element of the design. I chose **JetBrains Mono Variable**, a font developed by the creators of JetBrains IDEs. These were the first tools I used when learning to code, and though I later transitioned to **VS Code**, I kept JetBrains Mono as my primary display font. It’s open source and you can [find it here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

## 🧩 Features

This is a single-page website with clearly separated sections:

- **Hero** – A welcome message and call-to-action  
- **About** – A brief description of who I am and what I do  
- **Tech Stack** – A list of technologies I’m familiar with  
- **Projects** – Highlights of some of the work I’ve done  
- **Contact** – A form to reach out directly

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (vanilla)

No frameworks, no build tools — just clean, semantic, hand-written code.
